# Write a function that implements a substitution cipher. In a substitution 
# cipher one letter is substituted for another to garble the message. For example
# A -> Q, B -> T, C -> G etc. your function should take two parameters, the message 
# you want to encrypt, and a string that represents the mapping of the 26 letters 
# in the alphabet. Your function should return a string that is the encrypted version of the message.


# Write a function that decrypts the message from the previous exercise. It should 
# also take two parameters. The encrypted message, and the mixed up alphabet. The function
# should return a string that is the same as the original unencrypted message.
